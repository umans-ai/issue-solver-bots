### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Ensure your code follows the project's coding style and conventions**.
2. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
   ```
3. **Push your branch to your forked repository**:

4. **Open a pull request**: Navigate to the original repository, click on the "Pull Requests" tab, and then click "New Pull Request". Fill out the template provided and submit your pull request.

### Commit Message Guidelines

**Each commit should be a release candidate.** Keep commits atomic, focused, and independently deployable. Separate changes to different subsystems (`conversational-ui/`, `issue-solver/`) into distinct commits.

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) with emoji for our commit messages. Here are some examples:
- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 support ✨`
- `fix(api): resolve race condition in queue processing 🐛`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions 📝`
- `refactor(worker): simplify event handling ♻️`

Use the following types:
- `feat`: A new feature ✨
- `fix`: A bug fix 🐛
- `docs`: Documentation only changes 📝
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc) 💄
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature ♻️
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance ⚡️
- `test`: Adding missing or correcting existing tests ✅
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries 🔧

### Templates

Currently, we have the following templates:

- 🛠️ **GitLab CI Template**: Automates the resolution of issues via their GitLab ID or description using SWE-agent.
- 🛠️ **GitHub Actions Template**: Automates the resolution of issues via their GitHub ID or description using SWE-agent.

**More templates and features are coming soon! 🚧**

## Code of Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms. For more information on inclusion and diversity, refer to [Mozilla's Inclusion guidelines](https://github.com/mozilla/inclusion).

## License

By contributing to issue-solver-bots, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.

## Code Style

### Step-down rule

Organize code with higher-level functions first, calling into lower-level helpers below. This creates a natural reading flow from abstract to concrete.

### No unnecessary comments

Code should be self-explanatory. Avoid comments that restate what code does. Comments are only for explaining *why* something is done a certain way, not *what* it does. If you need a comment to explain what code does, refactor the code to be clearer.

## Project Guidelines

- For code that lives under `issue-solver/`, please also read `issue-solver/CONTRIBUTING.md` for coding/testing style and expectations.
