UMANS CODE TERMS OF USE
Effective date: February 1, 2026
Status: Public testing (Beta). Planned general launch: March 1.

These Terms govern your access to and use of Umans Code (the “Service”), including our website, app, CLI, APIs, and related services.
By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

1. Provider
   The Service is provided by UMANS AI (SAS), SIREN 943 333 708, RCS Nanterre, registered office: 14 Rue de Sévigné, 92120 Montrouge, France, VAT FR43943333708.
   Contact: contact@umans.ai

2. The Service
   Umans Code provides access to AI models operated by UMANS AI and is designed to work with many compatible tools.
   You may use the Service with any compatible tool of your choice.

We may change models, routing, endpoints, features, and safeguards to improve performance, safety, and reliability.

3. Beta status (public testing)
   The Service is in public testing. You understand that:
- features may change, degrade, or be discontinued;
- availability and performance are not guaranteed during Beta;
- we may enforce additional safeguards to protect the Service.

4. Your account and API Keys
   You are responsible for all activity under your account and for keeping API Keys confidential.
   You must not expose API Keys in public repositories or share them with third parties.
   Notify us promptly of any suspected unauthorized access at contact@umans.ai.

5. Acceptable use
   Allowed: personal and commercial software development work.

Not allowed:
a) sharing, reselling, renting, or sublicensing the Service or API Keys;
b) illegal, harmful, abusive, or deceptive activities (including malware, exploitation, fraud, or attempts to compromise systems);
c) interfering with or attempting to bypass rate limits, safeguards, or security measures;
d) using the Service to infringe intellectual property, confidentiality, or privacy rights.

We may suspend or terminate access if we believe you violated these Terms or to protect the Service and other users.

6. “Unlimited” and fairness safeguards
   Some plans may be described as “unlimited”. This means we do not charge per token as the primary billing metric.
   To maintain a reliable service for everyone, we may apply reasonable safeguards (for example concurrency limits, burst limits, or temporary throttling) and we may take action against abusive usage or API key sharing/reselling.

7. Customer Content and outputs
   “Customer Content” means inputs you submit (including prompts, code, files, and context) and outputs generated for you.
   You retain your rights to Customer Content.
   You are responsible for ensuring you have the rights to submit Customer Content and to use outputs in your context.

8. No prompt storage by default
   By default, UMANS AI does not store your request payloads (prompts, code, files) as product data.
   We monitor usage and errors using technical and usage metadata (for example timestamps, token counts, latency, and error codes).
   If you contact support, you may choose to share content for troubleshooting.

9. Service continuity routing
   To maintain continuity during high load or incidents, we may route some requests to third-party inference providers.
   When routed, your Customer Content is transmitted to that provider only to generate the response.
   For competitive and security reasons, we do not publish provider names publicly. Details are available on request.

10. Fees and billing
    Payments are processed by Stripe. UMANS AI does not receive or store card details.
    We only store Stripe identifiers (for example customer, subscription, and invoice IDs) and subscription status.
    Fees and plan details are shown at checkout or in the dashboard. Except where required by law, fees are non-refundable.

11. Disclaimer
    AI outputs may be incorrect, incomplete, or unsafe. You are responsible for reviewing outputs, testing code, and ensuring compliance with your requirements.
    The Service is provided “as is” and “as available” to the maximum extent permitted by law.

12. Limitation of liability
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, UMANS AI is not liable for indirect or consequential damages.
    UMANS AI’s total liability for claims relating to the Service is limited to the amount you paid for the Service in the 3 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
    Nothing limits liability that cannot be limited under applicable law.

13. Changes
    We may update these Terms. We will provide reasonable notice for material changes (for example via email or in-product notice).
    Continued use after the effective date means you accept the updated Terms.

14. Governing law
    These Terms are governed by French law. Courts of competent jurisdiction in France apply, unless mandatory consumer rules provide otherwise.
