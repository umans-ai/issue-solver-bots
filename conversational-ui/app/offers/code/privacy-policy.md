   By default, we do not store request payloads (prompts, code, files) as product data.
   If you contact support, you may choose to share content for troubleshooting.

4. Purposes and legal bases
   We process personal data to:
- provide the Service, authenticate users, manage accounts (contract)
- manage subscriptions and billing events (contract, legal obligations)
- ensure security, prevent abuse, maintain reliability (legitimate interests)
- provide customer support (contract, legitimate interests)

5. Cookies and similar technologies
   We use essential cookies for core functionality and security.
   We use analytics cookies and/or localStorage (PostHog) for usage measurement and product improvement.
   Where required by law (including in France), analytics is enabled only after you consent via our cookie preferences.

6. Recipients
   We share personal data only with:
- payment processor: Stripe
- infrastructure and hosting providers
- analytics provider: PostHog
- monitoring and error tracking providers (if used)
- third-party inference providers used for service continuity routing during high load or incidents

We do not sell personal data.

7. Service continuity routing and subprocessors
   During high load or incidents, we may route some requests to third-party inference providers to ensure continuity.
   When routed, Customer Content is transmitted to the provider only to generate the response.
   For competitive and security reasons, we do not publish provider names publicly. Details are available on request.

8. International transfers
   Because we serve customers globally and may route requests to third parties, personal data may be processed outside the EEA.
   Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or adequacy decisions.
   You can request more details at contact@umans.ai.

9. Retention
   We keep personal data only as long as needed:
- account data: for the life of the account, then up to 12 months
